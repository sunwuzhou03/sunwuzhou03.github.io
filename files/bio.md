Welcome! I am Wuzhou SUN, a 21-year-old third year Artificial Intelligence bachelor's student currently enrolled in [Mao Yisheng Honors College](https://mys.swjtu.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm) at [the Southwest Jiaotong University](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn/). I'm currently on a semester exchange program in [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) at [the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). 

My research interests are in areas related to reinforcement learning. 

Now I am as a Research intern with [Dr. Hailong Huang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/people/academic-staff/dr-huang-hailong/) in the AIMS group at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My project involved using reinforcement learning, computer vision techniques to develop an automated evaluation system for solo badminton matches. More information about my work can be found on my GitHub repository: [SoloShuttlePose](https://github.com/sunwuzhou03/SoloShuttlePose).

During the period from March 2023 to July 2023, I had the opportunity to study Reinforcement Learning under the guidance of [Prof. Luo Haonan](https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/luohaonan/en/index.htm). I implemented most of the main single-agent Reinforcement Learning algorithms, which you can find in this repository: [Single-Agent-RL-Algorithm](https://github.com/sunwuzhou03/Single-Agent-RL-Algorithm).

If you have any questions about my blogs or are interested in me, please feel free to email me!
